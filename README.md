SCM_Marshall is a 64bit application written in pascal on a cross platform compiler. It's part of an eco system of applications that make up the SwimClubMeet project. SCM lets amateur swimming clubs manage members and run their club night's.

Currently the only platform available is Windows. Future releases of the SCM_Marshall may include Android and iOS. This application runs best on MS Surface Pro.

Yes I know how you Americans spell Marshall incorrectly. ðŸ˜‰

## INFORMATION

### THE CODE

SCM_Marshall is written in Delphi, using Embarcadero's RAD Studio. This is a FMX project. Code is vanilla. No special VCL components have been used. FireDAC is used for database connectivity. Deployment of the application is with INNO. Database design was done in ERStudio.

### USING MARSHALL

After install, by default, an icon is placed on the desktop. If you elected to disable this, type **marshall** in the windows search bar to discover it. Else navigate to the **Artanemus** folder on the start bar. (All SCM applications and utilities are located in this folder.)

### ON START-UP

The application will ask you to login to the database. If you are running on a touch-pad, bring the application to full screen - you'll notice it will zoom (scaled up) making it easier to navigate and enter data. Currently there is no help file for this application.
Browse the events and heats to rally your members. Large buttons let you disqualify or scratch entrants (simplified method).  If you select to use FINA codes, then pick the code from the drop-down combo-box. A FINA cheat-sheet is provided in tab-sheet 4. In either method, you must post your changes for qualification to be enacted. 

Locked session or closed/raced heats cannot be edited.

> Use Windows **Apps and Features** to remove the application.
